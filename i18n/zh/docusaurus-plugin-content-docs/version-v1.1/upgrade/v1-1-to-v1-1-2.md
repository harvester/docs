## General information

Once there is an upgradable version, the Harvester GUI Dashboard page will show an upgrade button. For more details, please refer to [start an upgrade](./automatic.md#start-an-upgrade).

For the air-gap env upgrade, please refer to [prepare an air-gapped upgrade](./automatic.md#prepare-an-air-gapped-upgrade).


## Known issues

---

### 1. An upgrade is stuck when pre-draining a node

Starting from v1.1.0, Harvester will wait for all volumes to become healthy (when node count >= 3) before upgrading a node. Generally, users can check volumes' health if an upgrade is stuck in the "pre-draining" state.

Visit ["Access Embedded Longhorn"](../troubleshooting/harvester.md#access-embedded-rancher-and-longhorn-dashboards) to see how to access the embedded Longhorn GUI.

You can also check the pre-drain job logs. Please refer to [Phase 4: Upgrade nodes](./troubleshooting.md#phase-4-upgrade-nodes) in the troubleshooting guide.

### 2. An upgrade is stuck when pre-draining a node (case 2)

An upgrade is stuck, as shown in the screenshot below:

![](/img/v1.2/upgrade/known_issues/3216-stuck-pre-drain.png)

And the user can also observe multiple nodes have scheduling disabled.

```
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME    STATUS                     ROLES                       AGE   VERSION
node1   Ready                      control-plane,etcd,master   20d   v1.24.7+rke2r1
node2   Ready,SchedulingDisabled   control-plane,etcd,master   20d   v1.24.7+rke2r1
node3   Ready,SchedulingDisabled   control-plane,etcd,master   20d   v1.24.7+rke2r1
```

### 4. After an upgrade, a fleet bundle's status is `ErrApplied(1) [Cluster fleet-local/local: another operation (install/upgrade/rollback) is in progress]`

There is a chance fleet-managed bundle's stauts is `ErrApplied(1) [Cluster fleet-local/local: another operation (install/upgrade/rollback) is in progress]` after an upgrade. To check if this happened, run the following command:

```
kubectla get bundles -A
```

If you see the following output, then the cluster might hit the issue:

```
NAMESPACE     NAME                                          BUNDLEDEPLOYMENTS-READY   STATUS
fleet-local   fleet-agent-local                             0/1                       ErrApplied(1) [Cluster fleet-local/local: another operation (install/upgrade/rollback) is in progress]
fleet-local   local-managed-system-agent                    1/1

fleet-local   mcc-rancher-monitoring-crd                    1/1
```

### 5. An upgrade stops because it can't retrive harvester-release.yaml file

An upgrade is stopped with `Get "http://upgrade-repo-hvst-upgrade-mldzx.harvester-system/harvester-iso/harvester-release.yaml": 
context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)` message:

![](/img/v1.2/upgrade/known_issues/3729-error.png)

We fix this issue in v1.1.2. But for v1.1.0 and v1.1.1 users, the workaround is to start over an upgrade. Please refer to [Start over an upgrade](./troubleshooting.md#start-over-an-upgrade).

### 6. An upgrade is stuck in Pre-drained state

You might see an upgrade is stuck with "pre-drained" state:

![](/img/v1.2/upgrade/known_issues/3730-stuck.png)

This could be caused by a mis-placed PDB. To check if thet's the case, please do the following steps:

1. Assume the stuck node is `harvester-node-1`.
1. Check `instance-manager-e` or `instance-manager-r` pod names on the stuck node:

    ```
    $ kubectl get pods -n longhorn-system --field-selector spec.nodeName=harvester-node-1 | grep instance-manager
    instance-manager-r-d4ed2788          1/1     Running   0              3d8h
    ```

    We see `instance-manager-r-d4ed2788` pod is on the node. 

1. Check Rancher logs and verify that the `instance-manager-e` or `instance-manager-r` pod can't be drained:

    ```
    $ kubectl logs deployment/rancher -n cattle-system
    ...
    2023-03-28T17:10:52.199575910Z 2023/03/28 17:10:52 [INFO] [planner] rkecluster fleet-local/local: waiting: draining etcd node(s) custom-4f8cb698b24a,custom-a0f714579def
    2023-03-28T17:10:55.034453029Z evicting pod longhorn-system/instance-manager-r-d4ed2788
    2023-03-28T17:10:55.080933607Z error when evicting pods/"instance-manager-r-d4ed2788" -n "longhorn-system" (will retry after 5s): Cannot evict pod as it would violate the pod's disruption budget.
    ```

1. Run the command to check if there is a PDB associated with the stucking node:

    ```
    $ kubectl get pdb -n longhorn-system -o yaml | yq '.items[] | select(.spec.selector.matchLabels."longhorn.io/node"=="harvester-node-1") | .metadata.name'
    instance-manager-r-466e3c7f
    ```

1. Check the owner of the instance manager to this PDB:

    ```
    $ kubectl get instancemanager instance-manager-r-466e3c7f -n longhorn-system -o yaml | yq -e '.spec.nodeID'
    harvester-node-2
    ```

    If the outout doesn't matched the stuck node (here `harvester-node-2` is not `harvester-node-1`), then we can conclude this issue happens.

1. Before applying the workaround, first check if all volumes are healthy:

    ```
    kubectl get volumes -n longhorn-system -o yaml | yq '.items[] | select(.status.state == "attached")| .status.robustness'
    ```

    The output should be all in `healthy`. If this is not the case, you might want to uncordon nodes to make the volume become healthy again.

1.  Remove the mis-placed PDB:

    ```
    kubectl delete pdb instance-manager-r-466e3c7f -n longhorn-system
    ```
