# Import Images

To import virtual machine images in the **Images** page, enter a URL that can be accessed from the cluster. Note: The image name will be auto-filled using the URL address's filename. You can always customize it when required.

Currently, we support qcow2, raw, and ISO images.

!!!note
Uploading images from UI to the Harvester cluster is not supported yet. The feature request is being tracked on [#570](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/570).

Description and labels are optional.
