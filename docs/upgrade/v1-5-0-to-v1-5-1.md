## Known Issues

### 1. Virtual Machines That Use Migratable RWX Volumes Restart Unexpectedly

A [Longhorn issue](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11158) causes virtual machines that use migratable [RWX volumes](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/rancher/csi-driver/#rwx-volumes-support) to restart unexpectedly when the CSI plugin pods are restarted. This issue affects Harvester v1.4.x, v1.5.0, and v1.5.1.

The workaround is to disable the setting [Automatically Delete Workload Pod When The Volume Is Detached Unexpectedly](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.8.0/references/settings/#automatically-delete-workload-pod-when-the-volume-is-detached-unexpectedly) on the Longhorn UI before starting the upgrade. You must enable the setting again once the upgrade is completed.

The issue will be fixed in Longhorn v1.8.3, v1.9.1, and later versions. Harvester v1.6.0 will include Longhorn v1.9.1.
