## Known issues

### 1. The `harvester-seeder` add-on is not upgraded

When upgrading Harvester clusters from v1.2.1 to v1.2.2, the `harvester-seeder` add-on is not fully upgraded because the Helm chart versions do not match. The `harvester-seeder` chart bundled with Harvester v1.2.2 is of v0.1.1, while the `harvester-seeder` add-on uses the v0.1.0 chart.

```
Error: chart "harvester-seeder" matching 0.1.0 not found in harvester-seeder index. (try 'helm repo update'): no chart version found for harvester-seeder-0.1.0
```

If you enable the add-on after upgrading to Harvester v1.2.2, installing the chart will also not be possible because of the mentioned mismatch.

The workaround is to manually update the `harvester-seeder` add-on manifest using the following command. You must disable the add-on before patching.

```
kubectl -n harvester-system patch addons.harvesterhci harvester-seeder --type=json -p '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/version", "value": "0.1.1"}]'
```
