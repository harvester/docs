## General information

:::caution

- Starting from version v1.1.0, Harvester brings in the new [VLAN enhancement](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2236) feature. Due to the implementation changes, all user VMs must shut down during an upgrade. Please stop the VMs before an upgrade.

- We introduce [Storage Network](../../advanced/storagenetwork.md) feature in v1.1.0. Due to a [known issue](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3168), please [create required CRDs](../../advanced/storagenetwork.md#prerequisites) before using the feature.

:::

Once there is an upgradable version, the Harvester GUI Dashboard page will show an upgrade button. For more details, please refer to [start an upgrade](../automatic.md#start-an-upgrade).

For the air-gap env upgrade, please refer to [prepare an air-gapped upgrade](../automatic.md#prepare-an-air-gapped-upgrade).


## Known issues

---

### 1. An upgrade is stuck when pre-draining a node

Starting from v1.1.0, Harvester will wait for all volumes to become healthy (when node counts >= 3) before upgrading a node. Generally, users can check volumes' health if an upgrade is stuck in the "pre-draining" state.

Visit ["Access Embedded Longhorn"](../../troubleshooting/harvester.md#access-embedded-longhorn) to see how to access the embedded Longhorn GUI.

### 2. An upgrade is stuck after a node is pre-drained
