Starting from Rancher 2.10.0, Harvester integration is provided by [Harvester UI Extension](https://github.com/harvester/harvester-ui-extension). The Harvester UI Extension is a standard Rancher extension that built on the[@rancher/shell](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rancher/shell) library.


The original [Harvester dashboard](https://github.com/harvester/dashboard) will continue to support Harvester v1.3.x and v1.4.x releases. New features in future releases will be implemented in the Harvester UI Extension.




## Support Matrix

Starting from v1.5.0, the Harvester UI Extension version will align with the Harvester release version.
