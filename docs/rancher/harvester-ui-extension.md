Rancher 2.10.0 and later versions integrate with Harvester using the [Harvester UI Extension](https://github.com/harvester/harvester-ui-extension), which is built on the[@rancher/shell](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rancher/shell) library.

:::note
The current [Harvester UI](https://github.com/harvester/dashboard) will continue to support Harvester v1.3.x and v1.4.x releases. New features in later releases will be implemented in the Harvester UI Extension.
:::



## Support Matrix

Versions of the Harvester operating system and the Harvester UI Extension will align starting with v1.5.0.

The Harvester UI Extension is compatible with earlier versions of Harvester. It uses feature flags to display UI features that correspond to the Harvester cluster's version.

To access new UI features, install the latest Harvester UI Extension on your Rancher instance.

| Harvester UI Extension Version | Supported Rancher Versions |
| --- | --- |
| v1.0.x | Rancher 2.10.1 and later |
| v1.5.x | Rancher 2.11.0 and later |
| v1.6.x | Rancher 2.12.0 and later |

Installing the extension over the network is not possible in air-gapped environments, so you must perform the workaround outlined in [Harvester UI Extension with Rancher Integration](/v1.5/airgap#harvester-ui-extension-with-rancher-integration).
