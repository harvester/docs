# VM Backup & Restore

VM backups are created from the **Virtual Machines** page. The VM backup volumes will be stored in the **Backup Target** (an NFS or S3 server) and they can be used to either restore a new VM or replace an existing VM.

!!! Note
    A backup target must be set up. For more information, see [Backup Target Setup](#backup-target-setup). If the BackupTarget has not been set, youâ€™ll be presented with a prompt message.

## Configure Backup Target
