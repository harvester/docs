_Available as of v1.1.0_

A `PCIDevice` in Harvester represents a host device with a PCI address. 
The devices can be passed through the hypervisor to a VM by creating a `PCIDeviceClaim` resource, 
or by using the UI to enable passthrough. Passing a device through the hypervisor means that 
the VM can directly access the device, and effectively owns the device. A VM can even install 
its own drivers for that device.

This is accomplished by using the `pcidevices-controller` addon.

To use the PCI devices feature, users need to enable the `pcidevices-controller` addon first.

Once the `pcidevices-controller` addon is deployed successfully, it can take a few minutes for it to scan and the PCIDevice CRDs to become available.

## Enabling Passthrough on a PCI Device

1. Now go to the `Advanced -> PCI Devices` page:

   ![](/img/v1.2/pcidevices/advanced-pcidevices-index.png)

1. Search for your device by vendor name (e.g. NVIDIA, Intel, etc.) or device name.

   ![](/img/v1.2/pcidevices/search-pcidevices.png)

1. Select the devices you want to enable for passthrough:

   ![](/img/v1.2/pcidevices/select-pcidevices.png)

1. Then click **Enable Passthrough** and read the warning message. If you still want to enable these devices, click **Enable** and wait for all devices to be `Enabled`.
   :::caution
   Please do not use `host-owned` PCI devices (e.g., management and VLAN NICs). Incorrect device allocation may cause damage to your cluster, including node failure.

## Attaching PCI Devices to a VM

After enabling these PCI devices, you can navigate to the **Virtual Machines** page and select **Edit Config** to pass these devices.

![](/img/v1.2/pcidevices/vm-pcidevices-edit-config.png)

Select **PCI Devices** and use the **Available PCI Devices** drop-down. Select the devices you want to attach from the list displayed and then click **Save**.

## Using a passed-through PCI Device inside the VM

Boot the VM up, and run `lspci` inside the VM, the attached PCI devices will show up, although the PCI address in the VM won't necessarily match the PCI address in the host. 


## Installing drivers for your PCI device inside the VM

This is just like installing drivers in the host. The PCI passthrough feature will bind the host device to the `vfio-pci` driver, which gives VMs the ability to use their own drivers. [Here is a screenshot](https://tobilehman.com/posts/suse-harvester-pci/#toc) of NVIDIA drivers being installed in a VM. It includes a CUDA example that proves that the device drivers work.

## SRIOV Network Devices
_Available as of v1.2.0_

![](/img/v1.2/pcidevices/SriovNetworkDevicesLink.png)

The `pcidevices-controller` addon can now scan network interfaces on the underlying hosts and check if they support SRIOV Virtual Functions (VFs). If a valid device is found, `pcidevices-controller` will generate a new `SRIOVNetworkDevice` object.

![](/img/v1.2/pcidevices/SriovNetworkDevicesList.png)

To create VFs on a SriovNetworkDevice, you can click **⋮ > Enable** and then define the **Number of Virtual Functions**.
![](/img/v1.2/pcidevices/SriovNetworkDeviceEnable.png)

![](/img/v1.2/pcidevices/SriovNetworkVFDefinition.png)

The `pcidevices-controller` will define the VFs on the network interface and report the new PCI device status for the newly created VFs.

![](/img/v1.2/pcidevices/SriovNetworkDevicesVFStatus.png)

On the next re-scan, the `pcidevices-controller` will create the PCIDevices for VFs. This can take up to 1 minute.

You can now navigate to the **PCI Devices** page to view the new devices.

We have also introduced a new filter to help you filter PCI devices by the underlying network interface.

![](/img/v1.2/pcidevices/SriovNetworkDevicesFilter.png)

The newly created PCI device can be passed through to virtual machines like any other PCI device.

## USB Devices

_Available as of v1.4.0_

A `USBDevice` resource in Harvester represents a USB device on the node. USB devices can be "passed through" by the hypervisor to allow direct access from VMs. This is accomplished through the `pcidevices-controller` add-on. To use USB passthrough, you can either create a `USBDeviceClaim` resource or enable the feature on the Harvester UI. 

USB passthrough is slightly different from PCI passthrough. For example, you can fully control a USB controller with four USB ports by creating a `PCIDeviceClaim`. However, you can also create a `USBDeviceClaim` to control only one USB port. The other three USB ports remain available to the node.

:::caution
Before you remove the USB device, detach it from the virtual machine and then disable passthrough on the **USB Devices** screen.
:::

### Enable Passthrough on a USB Device

1. On the Harvester UI, go to **Advanced** > **USB Devices**.

    ![](/img/v1.4/usbdevices/index.png)

1. Locate the device in the list.

    ![](/img/v1.4/usbdevices/search.png)

1. Select the target device, and then select **⋮** > **Enable Passthrough**.

   ![](/img/v1.4/usbdevices/select.png)

1. Read the confirmation message, and then click **Enable**. Allow some time for the device state to change to **Enabled**.

    ![](/img/v1.4/usbdevices/enable-done.png)

### Attach a USB Device to a Virtual Machine

1. Verify that passthrough is enabled on the target device.

1. Go to **Virtual Machines**, and then create a virtual machine or edit the configuration of an existing virtual machine.

1. On the virtual machine configuration screen, go to the **USB Devices** tab and then select a device from the **Available USB Devices** list. 

    ![](/img/v1.4/usbdevices/attach-vm.png)

1. Click **Create** or **Save**.

### View USB Devices Attached to a Virtual Machine

1. Start and then access the virtual machine.

1. Run `lsusb`. This utility displays information about USB buses and attached devices.

    ![](/img/v1.4/usbdevices/usb-in-vm.png)

### Limitations

- Virtual machines with attached USB devices cannot be live-migrated because the devices are bound to a specific node.

- Hot-plugging and replugging of USB devices is not supported. For more information, see [KubeVirt Issue #11979](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/issues/11979).

- If the device path changes when you reattach the device or reboot the node, you must detach the device from the virtual machine and then enable passthrough again.
