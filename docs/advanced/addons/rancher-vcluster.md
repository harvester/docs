_Available as of v1.2.0_

The `rancher-vcluster` addon allows you to run Rancher Manager as a workload on the underlying Harvester cluster and is implemented using [vcluster](https://www.vcluster.com/).

The addon runs a nested K3s cluster in the `rancher-vcluster` namespace and deploys Rancher to this cluster.

During the installation, the ingress for Rancher is synced to the Harvester cluster, allowing end users to access Rancher.

## Installing rancher-vcluster

The `rancher-vcluster` addon is not packaged with Harvester, but you can find it in the [expreimental-addon repo](https://github.com/harvester/experimental-addons).

Assuming you are using the Harvester kubeconfig, you can run the following commands to install the addon:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvester/experimental-addons/main/rancher-vcluster/rancher-vcluster.yaml
```

## Configuring rancher-vcluster

After installing the addon, you need to configure it from the Harvester UI as follows:

1. Select **Advanced** > **Addons**.
1. Find the `rancher-vcluster` addon and select **â‹®** > **Edit Config**.

1. In the **Hostname** field, enter a valid DNS record pointing to the Harvester VIP. This is essential as the vcluster ingress is synced to the parent Harvester cluster. A valid hostname is used to filter ingress traffic to the vcluster workload.
1. In the **Bootstrap Password** field, enter the bootstrap password for the new Rancher deployed on the vcluster.

Once the addon is deployed, Rancher can take a few minutes to become available. 

You can then access Rancher via the hostname DNS record that you provided.

See [Rancher Integration](../../rancher/virtualization-management.md) for more information.

:::note Disabling rancher-vcluster

The `rancher-vcluster` addon is deployed on a `vcluster` Statefulset that uses a Longhorn PVC.

When `rancher-vcluster` is disabled, the PVC `data-rancher-vcluster-0` will remain in the `rancher-vcluster` namespace.

If you enable the addon again, the PVC is re-used, and Rancher will have the old state available again.

If you want to wipe the data, ensure that the PVC is deleted.
