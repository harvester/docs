SUSE provides [SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE)](https://www.suse.com/download/sles/) and [openSUSE Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/) virtual machine (VM) images suitable for use in Harvester. These images are built on the [openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/) (OBS) using the [Kiwi](https://osinside.github.io/kiwi/) image building tool, and can be used immediately after downloading.

For most cases, you can use the *Minimal VM Cloud* qcow2 images because these include the cloud-init tool necessary for automatic VM configuration. Other image variants require you to log onto the VM console and then perform initial configuration.

:::info
The *Minimal VM Cloud* images were named *Minimal VM OpenStack Cloud* in releases earlier than SLES 15 SP5 and openSUSE 15.5.

## Using the openSUSE Build Service (OBS)

You can create custom images based on what SUSE provides using OBS [image templates](https://build.opensuse.org/image_templates), which are pre-configured Kiwi image configurations. For example, if you want use other packages with SLE 15 SP5, you can create an image using the *SLE 15 SP5 Minimal* template. OBS provides an interface for adding packages and automatically builds the image, which you can download and then upload to Harvester. For more information, see the [OBS User Guide](https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-user-guide/).

### 1. Create a custom image based on an existing template.

1. Go to https://build.opensuse.org/image_templates. You must sign in to your openSUSE account to access the resources.

1. Select the template that you want to use.

1. Specify a name for the image, and then select **Create appliance**.

   OBS automatically builds the image. By default, the interface shows the **Overview** tab, which contains information such as the number of included packages and the build status.

### 2. Select image profiles and add packages.

1. Go to the **Software** tab.

1. Select the image profiles that you want OBS to build.

1. (Optional) Add and remove packages.

### 3. (Optional) Switch to *View Package* mode.

*View Package* mode provides more granular control over configuration. To switch, click the *View Package* icon in the navigation bar.

The **Source Files** section of the **Overview** tab shows all the files that comprise your Kiwi template. You can edit any of the files by selecting the corresponding file name.

### 4. (Optional) Edit the configuration file `Minimal.kiwi`.

Select the file name to open the text editor. The `<packages type="image">` section lists the packages to be installed. You can specify additional packages for each image profile.

By default, the *Cloud* image profile (`<package type="image" profiles="Cloud">`) installs the *kernel-default-base* package. In the following example, that package is replaced with *kernel-default*, which includes modules necessary for iSCSI support.

### 5. Wait for OBS to finish building the image.

Once the process is completed, the **Build Results** section on the **Overview** tab shows the status *succeeded*.

![](/img/v1.3/advanced/custom-vm-09-build-succeeded.png)

The **Build Results** section also contains a download link for the new image.

### 6. Enable publishing to share the image.

To allow the public to download your custom image, go to the **Repositories** tab of your OBS project and enable the *Publish* flag.

![](/img/v1.3/advanced/custom-vm-12-project-publish-repositories.png)

Your image is published to https://download.opensuse.org/ (under `repositories/home:/YOUR_USER_NAME:/branches:/SUSE:/Templates:/Images:/`).

## Using the Kiwi Command-line Tool

As an alternative to the openSUSE Build Service, you can create images locally using the Kiwi command-line tool. For more information about the tool, see [Building Linux System Appliances with KIWI Next Generation (KIWI NG)](https://documentation.suse.com/appliance/kiwi-9/html/kiwi/index.html).

To create custom images, you must first download the file `Minimal.kiwi`, and the scripts `config.sh` and `editbootinstall_rpi.sh` from the corresponding project on OBS.
