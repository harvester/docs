## General information

An **Upgrade** button appears on the **Dashboard** screen whenever a new Harvester version that you can upgrade to becomes available. For more information, see [Start an upgrade](./automatic.md#start-an-upgrade).

For air-gapped environments, see [Prepare an air-gapped upgrade](./automatic.md#prepare-an-air-gapped-upgrade).

## Known issues

### 1. Upgrade stuck in the `Upgrading System Service` state

Expired certificates of certain system services may cause an upgrade to become stuck in the `Upgrading System Service` state for an extended period. To resolve this issue, perform the following steps:

1. Identify the name of the `apply-manifest` job.

    ```
    kubectl get jobs -n harvester-system -l harvesterhci.io/upgradeComponent=manifest
    ```

    Example output:
    ```
    NAME                                 COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
    hvst-upgrade-9gmg2-apply-manifests   0/1           46s        46s
    ```

1. Check the logs of the `apply-manifest` job.

    ```
    kubectl logs jobs/hvst-upgrade-9gmg2-apply-manifests -n harvester-system
    ```

    If the following messages appear in the log, continue to the next step:

    ```
    Waiting for CAPI cluster fleet-local/local to be provisioned (current phase: Provisioning, current generation: 30259)...
    Waiting for CAPI cluster fleet-local/local to be provisioned (current phase: Provisioning, current generation: 30259)...
    Waiting for CAPI cluster fleet-local/local to be provisioned (current phase: Provisioning, current generation: 30259)...
    Waiting for CAPI cluster fleet-local/local to be provisioned (current phase: Provisioning, current generation: 30259)...
    ```

1. Check the state of the Cluster API (CAPI) cluster.

    ```
    kubectl get clusters.provisioning.cattle.io local -n fleet-local -o yaml
    ```

    If the output is similar to the following example, the issue likely exists in the cluster.
    ```
        - lastUpdateTime: "2023-01-17T16:26:48Z"
          message: 'configuring bootstrap node(s) custom-24cb32ce8387: waiting for probes:
            kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler'
          reason: Waiting
          status: Unknown
          type: Updated
    ```

1. Identify the hostname of the affected node, and implement the [workaround](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3863#issuecomment-1539681311) to see if service certificates expire.

    ```
    kubectl get machines.cluster.x-k8s.io -n fleet-local <machine_name> -o yaml | yq .status.nodeRef.name
    ```

    Replace `<machine_name>` with the name of the affected node (as stated in the output of the previous step).

    :::note

    If multiple nodes joined the cluster around the same time, you must implement the [workaround](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3863#issuecomment-1539681311) on all those nodes.

### 2. The `harvester-seeder` add-on is not upgraded

When upgrading Harvester clusters from v1.2.1 to v1.2.2, the `harvester-seeder` add-on is not fully upgraded because the Helm chart versions do not match. The `harvester-seeder` chart bundled with Harvester v1.2.2 is of v0.1.1, while the `harvester-seeder` add-on uses the v0.1.0 chart.

```
Error: chart "harvester-seeder" matching 0.1.0 not found in harvester-seeder index. (try 'helm repo update'): no chart version found for harvester-seeder-0.1.0
```

If you enable the add-on after upgrading to Harvester v1.2.2, installing the chart will also not be possible because of the mentioned mismatch.

The workaround is to manually update the `harvester-seeder` add-on manifest using the following command. You must disable the add-on before patching.

```
kubectl -n harvester-system patch addons.harvesterhci harvester-seeder --type=json -p '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/version", "value": "0.1.1"}]'
```
