## General Information

An **Upgrade** button appears on the **Dashboard** screen whenever a new Harvester version that you can upgrade to becomes available. For more information, see [Start an upgrade](./automatic.md#start-an-upgrade).

Harvester v1.4.2 and v1.4.3 use the same minor version of RKE2 (v1.31). This makes it possible to upgrade directly from Harvester v1.4.1 to v1.4.3, without needing to upgrade to v1.4.2 first.

For air-gapped environments, see [Prepare an air-gapped upgrade](./automatic.md#prepare-an-air-gapped-upgrade).

## Known Issues

### 1. Air-gapped Upgrade Stuck with `ImagePullBackOff` Error in Fluentd and Fluent Bit Pods

The upgrade may become stuck at the very beginning of the process, as indicated by 0% progress and items marked **Pending** in the **Upgrade** dialog of the Harvester UI.

![](/img/v1.5/upgrade/upgrade-dialog-with-empty-status.png)

Specifically, Fluentd and Fluent Bit pods may become stuck in the `ImagePullBackOff` status. To check the status of the pods, run the following commands:

```bash
$ kubectl -n harvester-system get upgrades -l harvesterhci.io/latestUpgrade=true
NAME                 AGE
hvst-upgrade-x2hz8   7m14s

$ kubectl -n harvester-system get upgradelogs -l harvesterhci.io/upgrade=hvst-upgrade-x2hz8
NAME                            UPGRADE
hvst-upgrade-x2hz8-upgradelog   hvst-upgrade-x2hz8

$ kubectl -n harvester-system get pods -l harvesterhci.io/upgradeLog=hvst-upgrade-x2hz8-upgradelog
NAME                                                        READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
hvst-upgrade-x2hz8-upgradelog-downloader-6cdb864dd9-6bw98   1/1     Running            0          7m7s
hvst-upgrade-x2hz8-upgradelog-infra-fluentbit-2nq7q         0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          7m42s
hvst-upgrade-x2hz8-upgradelog-infra-fluentbit-697wf         0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          7m42s
hvst-upgrade-x2hz8-upgradelog-infra-fluentbit-kd8kl         0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          7m42s
hvst-upgrade-x2hz8-upgradelog-infra-fluentd-0               0/2     ImagePullBackOff   0          7m42s
```

This occurs because the following container images are neither preloaded in the cluster nodes nor pulled from the internet:

- `ghcr.io/kube-logging/fluentd:v1.15-ruby3`
- `ghcr.io/kube-logging/config-reloader:v0.0.5`
- `fluent/fluent-bit:2.1.8`

To fix the issue, perform any of the following actions:

- Update the Logging CR to use the images that are already preloaded in the cluster nodes. To do this, run the following commands against the cluster:

  ```bash
  # Get the Logging CR names
  OPERATOR_LOGGING_NAME=$(kubectl get loggings -l app.kubernetes.io/name=rancher-logging -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  INFRA_LOGGING_NAME=$(kubectl get loggings -l harvesterhci.io/upgradeLogComponent=infra -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")

  # Gather image info from operator's Logging CR
  FLUENTD_IMAGE_REPO=$(kubectl get loggings $OPERATOR_LOGGING_NAME -o jsonpath="{.spec.fluentd.image.repository}")
  FLUENTD_IMAGE_TAG=$(kubectl get loggings $OPERATOR_LOGGING_NAME -o jsonpath="{.spec.fluentd.image.tag}")

  FLUENTBIT_IMAGE_REPO=$(kubectl get loggings $OPERATOR_LOGGING_NAME -o jsonpath="{.spec.fluentbit.image.repository}")
  FLUENTBIT_IMAGE_TAG=$(kubectl get loggings $OPERATOR_LOGGING_NAME -o jsonpath="{.spec.fluentbit.image.tag}")

  CONFIG_RELOADER_IMAGE_REPO=$(kubectl get loggings $OPERATOR_LOGGING_NAME -o jsonpath="{.spec.fluentd.configReloaderImage.repository}")
  CONFIG_RELOADER_IMAGE_TAG=$(kubectl get loggings $OPERATOR_LOGGING_NAME -o jsonpath="{.spec.fluentd.configReloaderImage.tag}")

  # Patch the Logging CR
  kubectl patch logging $INFRA_LOGGING_NAME --type=json -p="[{\"op\":\"replace\",\"path\":\"/spec/fluentbit/image\",\"value\":{\"repository\":\"$FLUENTBIT_IMAGE_REPO\",\"tag\":\"$FLUENTBIT_IMAGE_TAG\"}}]"
  kubectl patch logging $INFRA_LOGGING_NAME --type=json -p="[{\"op\":\"replace\",\"path\":\"/spec/fluentd/image\",\"value\":{\"repository\":\"$FLUENTD_IMAGE_REPO\",\"tag\":\"$FLUENTD_IMAGE_TAG\"}}]"
  kubectl patch logging $INFRA_LOGGING_NAME --type=json -p="[{\"op\":\"replace\",\"path\":\"/spec/fluentd/configReloaderImage\",\"value\":{\"repository\":\"$CONFIG_RELOADER_IMAGE_REPO\",\"tag\":\"$CONFIG_RELOADER_IMAGE_TAG\"}}]"
  ```

  The status of the Fluentd and Fluent Bit pods should change to `Running` in a moment and the upgrade process should continue after the Logging CR is updated. If the Fluentd pod is still in the `ImagePullBackOff` status, try deleting it with the following command to force it to restart:

  ```bash
  UPGRADE_NAME=$(kubectl -n harvester-system get upgrades -l harvesterhci.io/latestUpgrade=true -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
  UPGRADELOG_NAME=$(kubectl -n harvester-system get upgradelogs -l harvesterhci.io/upgrade=$UPGRADE_NAME -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

  kubectl -n harvester-system delete pods -l harvesterhci.io/upgradeLog=$UPGRADELOG_NAME,harvesterhci.io/upgradeLogComponent=aggregator
  ```

- On a computer with internet access, pull the required container images and then export them to a TAR file. Next, transfer the TAR file to the cluster nodes and then import the images by running the following commands on each node:

  ```bash
  # Pull down the three container images
  docker pull ghcr.io/kube-logging/fluentd:v1.15-ruby3
  docker pull ghcr.io/kube-logging/config-reloader:v0.0.5
  docker pull fluent/fluent-bit:2.1.8

  # Export the images to a tar file
  docker save \
    ghcr.io/kube-logging/fluentd:v1.15-ruby3 \
    ghcr.io/kube-logging/config-reloader:v0.0.5 \
    fluent/fluent-bit:2.1.8 > upgradelog-images.tar

  # After transferring the tar file to the cluster nodes, import the images (need to be run on each node)
  ctr -n k8s.io images import upgradelog-images.tar
  ```

  The upgrade process should continue after the images are preloaded.

- (Not recommended) Restart the upgrade process with logging disabled. Ensure that the **Enable Logging** checkbox in the **Upgrade** dialog is not selected.

### 2. Oversized Volumes

In Harvester v1.4.3, which uses Longhorn v1.7.3, oversized volumes (for example, 999999 Gi in size) are marked **Not Ready** and cannot be deleted.

To resolve this issue, perform the following steps:

1. Temporarily remove the PVC webhook rule.

   ```bash
   RULE_INDEX=$(kubectl get \
     validatingwebhookconfiguration longhorn-webhook-validator -o json \
     | jq '.webhooks[0].rules | map(.resources[0] == "persistentvolumeclaims") | index(true)')
   
   if [ -n "$RULE_INDEX" -a "$RULE_INDEX" != "null" ]; then
     kubectl patch validatingwebhookconfiguration longhorn-webhook-validator \
       --type='json' \
       -p="[{'op': 'remove', 'path': '/webhooks/0/rules/$RULE_INDEX'}]"
   fi
   ```

1. Wait for the related PVC to be deleted.

1. Restore the PVC webhook rule to re-enable validation.

   ```bash
   kubectl patch validatingwebhookconfiguration longhorn-webhook-validator \
     --type='json' \
     -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/webhooks/0/rules/-", "value": {"apiGroups":[""],"apiVersions":["v1"],"operations":["UPDATE"],"resources":["persistentvolumeclaims"],"scope":"Namespaced"}}]'
   ```

The issue will be addressed in Longhorn v1.8.2, which will likely be included in Harvester v1.5.1.

### 3. Non-Root Users on Guest Clusters Unable to Access RWX Volumes

Non-root users on guest clusters encounter unexpected "Permission denied" errors when accessing RWX volumes. This is caused by a [regression issue](https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-ganesha/issues/1132) in nfs-ganesha v6.0+, which affects v1.7.3 of the `longhorn-share-manager` image.

You can resolve the issue by replacing `longhorn-share-manager:v1.7.3` with the hotfixed image `longhorn-share-manager:v1.7.3-hotfix-1`.

1. Edit the `longhorn-manager` DaemonSet by running the following command:

  ```bash
  kubectl -n longhorn-system edit daemonset/longhorn-manager
  ```

1. In the `spec.containers.command` field, change the `--share-manager-image` to `longhornio/longhorn-share-manager:v1.7.3-hotfix-1`.
  ```yaml
  ...
    spec:
      containers:
      - command:
        - longhorn-manager
        - -d
        - daemon
        - --engine-image
        - longhornio/longhorn-engine:v1.7.3
        - --instance-manager-image
        - longhornio/longhorn-instance-manager:v1.7.3
        - --share-manager-image
        - longhornio/longhorn-share-manager:v1.7.3-hotfix-1
        - --backing-image-manager-image
        - longhornio/backing-image-manager:v1.7.3
        - --support-bundle-manager-image
        - longhornio/support-bundle-kit:v0.0.51
        - --manager-image
        - longhornio/longhorn-manager:v1.7.3
        - --service-account
        - longhorn-service-account
        - --upgrade-version-check
  ...
  ```

1. Once the update is applied, restart workloads that are using RWX volumes.

:::caution

- Do not use the hotfixed image if you are not affected by the issue.

- If you are using the hotfixed image and want to upgrade Harvester v1.5.x, you must edit the `longhorn-manager` DaemonSet and revert to the `longhorn-share-manager:v1.7.3` image before starting the upgrade.

### 4. Virtual Machines That Use Migratable RWX Volumes Restart Unexpectedly

A [Longhorn issue](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11158) causes virtual machines that use migratable [RWX volumes](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/rancher/csi-driver/#rwx-volumes-support) to restart unexpectedly when the CSI plugin pods are restarted. This issue affects Harvester v1.4.x, v1.5.0, and v1.5.1.

The workaround is to disable the setting [Automatically Delete Workload Pod When The Volume Is Detached Unexpectedly](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.8.0/references/settings/#automatically-delete-workload-pod-when-the-volume-is-detached-unexpectedly) on the Longhorn UI before starting the upgrade. You must enable the setting again once the upgrade is completed.

The issue will be fixed in Longhorn v1.8.3, v1.9.1, and later versions. Harvester v1.6.0 will include Longhorn v1.9.1.
