## General information

An **Upgrade** button appears on the **Dashboard** screen whenever a new Harvester version that you can upgrade to becomes available. For more information, see [Start an upgrade](./automatic.md#start-an-upgrade).

For air-gapped environments, see [Prepare an air-gapped upgrade](./automatic.md#prepare-an-air-gapped-upgrade).

:::info important

Check the disk usage of the operating system images on each node before starting the upgrade. To do this, access the node via SSH and run the command `du -sh /run/initramfs/cos-state/cOS/*`.

Example:

```
# du -sh /run/initramfs/cos-state/cOS/*
1.7G    /run/initramfs/cos-state/cOS/active.img
3.1G    /run/initramfs/cos-state/cOS/passive.img
```

If `passive.img` (which represents the previously installed Harvester v1.4.0 image) consumes 3.1G of disk space, run the following commands using the root account:

```
# mount -o remount,rw /run/initramfs/cos-state
# fallocate --dig-holes /run/initramfs/cos-state/cOS/passive.img
# mount -o remount,ro /run/initramfs/cos-state
```
`passive.img` is converted to a sparse file, which should only consume 1.7G of disk space (the same as `active.img`). This ensures that each node has enough free space, preventing the upgrade process from becoming [stuck in the "Waiting Reboot" state](#3-upgrade-is-stuck-in-the-waiting-reboot-state).

## Known issues

---

### 1. Upgrade is stuck in the "Pre-drained" state

The upgrade process may become stuck in the "Pre-drained" state. Kubernetes is supposed to drain the workload on the node, but some factors may cause the process to stall.

![](/img/v1.2/upgrade/known_issues/3730-stuck.png)

A possible cause is processes related to orphan engines of the Longhorn Instance Manager. To determine if this applies to your situation, perform the following steps:

1. Check the name of the `instance-manager` pod on the stuck node.

    Example:

    The stuck node is `harvester-node-1`, and the name of the Instance Manager pod is `instance-manager-d80e13f520e7b952f4b7593fc1883e2a`.

    ```
    $ kubectl get pods -n longhorn-system --field-selector spec.nodeName=harvester-node-1 | grep instance-manager
    instance-manager-d80e13f520e7b952f4b7593fc1883e2a          1/1     Running   0              3d8h
    ```

1. Check the Longhorn Manager logs for informational messages.

    Example:

    ```
    $ kubectl -n longhorn-system logs daemonsets/longhorn-manager
    ...
    time="2025-01-14T00:00:01Z" level=info msg="Node instance-manager-d80e13f520e7b952f4b7593fc1883e2a is marked unschedulable but removing harvester-node-1 PDB is blocked: some volumes are still attached InstanceEngines count 1 pvc-9ae0e9a5-a630-4f0c-98cc-b14893c74f9e-e-0" func="controller.(*InstanceManagerController).syncInstanceManagerPDB" file="instance_manager_controller.go:823" controller=longhorn-instance-manager node=harvester-node-1
    ```

    The `instance-manager` pod cannot be drained because of the engine `pvc-9ae0e9a5-a630-4f0c-98cc-b14893c74f9e-e-0`.

1. Check if the engine is still running on the stuck node.

    Example:

    ```
    $ kubectl -n longhorn-system get engines.longhorn.io pvc-9ae0e9a5-a630-4f0c-98cc-b14893c74f9e-e-0 -o jsonpath='{"Current state: "}{.status.currentState}{"\nNode ID: "}{.spec.nodeID}{"\n"}'
    Current state: stopped
    Node ID:
    ```

    The issue likely exists if the output shows that the engine is not running or even the engine is not found.

1. Check if all volumes are healthy.

    ```
    kubectl get volumes -n longhorn-system -o yaml | yq '.items[] | select(.status.state == "attached")| .status.robustness'
    ```

    All volumes must be marked `healthy`. If this is not the case, please help to report the issue.

1. Remove the `instance-manager` pod's PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) .

    Example:

    ```
    kubectl delete pdb instance-manager-d80e13f520e7b952f4b7593fc1883e2a -n longhorn-system
    ```

### 2. Upgrade with default StorageClass that is not harvester-longhorn

Harvester adds the annotation `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"` to `harvester-longhorn`, which is the original default StorageClass. When you replace `harvester-longhorn` with another StorageClass, the following occur:

- The Harvester ManagedChart shows the error message `cannot patch "harvester-longhorn" with kind StorageClass: admission webhook "validator.harvesterhci.io" denied the request: default storage class %!s(MISSING) already exists, please reset it first`.

- The webhook denies the upgrade request.

    ![Upgrade with another default storage class](/img/v1.4/upgrade/upgrade-with-another-default-storage-class.png)

You can perform any of the following workarounds:

- Set `harvester-longhorn` as the default StorageClass.

- Add `spec.values.storageClass.defaultStorageClass: false` to the `harvester` ManagedChart.

    ```
    kubectl edit managedchart harvester -n fleet-local
    ```

- Add `timeoutSeconds: 600` to the Harvester ManagedChart spec.

    ```
    kubectl edit managedchart harvester -n fleet-local
    ```

For more information, see [Issue #7375](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/7375).

### 3. Upgrade is stuck in the "Waiting Reboot" state

The upgrade process may become stuck in the "Waiting Reboot" state after the Harvester v1.4.1 image is installed on a node and a reboot is initiated. At this point, the upgrade controller observes if the Harvester v1.4.1 operating system is running.

If the Harvester v1.4.1 image (hereafter referred to as `active.img`) fails to boot for any reason, the node automatically restarts in fallback mode and boots the previously installed Harvester v1.4.0 image (hereafter referred to as `passive.img`). The upgrade controller is unable to detect the expected operating system, so the upgrade remains stuck until an administrator fixes the problem with `active.img`.

`active.img` can become corrupted and unbootable because of insufficient disk space in the COS_STATE partition during the upgrade. This occurs if Harvester v1.4.0 was originally installed on the node and the system was configured to use a separate data disk. The issue does not occur in the following situations:

- The system has a single disk that is shared by the operating system and data.
- An earlier Harvester version was originally installed and then later upgraded to v1.4.0.

To check if the issue exists in your environment, perform the following steps:

1. Access the node via SSH and log in using the root account.

1. Run the commands `cat /proc/cmdline` and `head -n1 /etc/harvester-release.yaml`.

    Example:

    ```
    # cat /proc/cmdline
    BOOT_IMAGE=(loop0)/boot/vmlinuz console=tty1 root=LABEL=COS_STATE cos-img/filename=/cOS/passive.img panic=0 net.ifnames=1 rd.cos.oemlabel=COS_OEM rd.cos.mount=LABEL=COS_OEM:/oem rd.cos.mount=LABEL=COS_PERSISTENT:/usr/local rd.cos.oemtimeout=120 audit=1 audit_backlog_limit=8192 intel_iommu=on amd_iommu=on iommu=pt multipath=off upgrade_failure
    
    # head -n1 /etc/harvester-release.yaml
    harvester: v1.4.0
    ```

    The presence of `cos-img/filename=/cOS/passive.img` and `upgrade_failure` in the output indicates that the system booted into fallback mode. The Harvester version in `/etc/harvester-release.yaml` confirms that the system is currently using the v1.4.0 image.

1. Check if `active.img` is corrupted by running the command `fsck.ext2 -nf /run/initramfs/cos-state/cOS/active.img`.

    Example:

    ```
    # fsck.ext2 -nf /run/initramfs/cos-state/cOS/active.img
    e2fsck 1.46.4 (18-Aug-2021)
    Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
    Pass 2: Checking directory structure
    
      [...a list of various different errors may appear here...]
    
    e2fsck: aborted
    
    COS_ACTIVE: ********** WARNING: Filesystem still has errors **********
    ```

1. Check the partition sizes by running the command `lsblk -o NAME,LABEL,SIZE`.

    Example:

    ```
    # lsblk -o NAME,LABEL,SIZE
    NAME   LABEL             SIZE
    loop0  COS_ACTIVE          3G
    sr0                     1024M
    vda                      250G
    â”œâ”€vda1 COS_GRUB           64M
    â”œâ”€vda2 COS_OEM            64M
    â”œâ”€vda3 COS_RECOVERY        4G
    â”œâ”€vda4 COS_STATE           8G
    â””â”€vda5 COS_PERSISTENT  237.9G
    vdb    HARV_LH_DEFAULT   128G
    ```

    The output in the example shows a COS_STATE partition that is 8G in size. In this specific case, which involves an unsuccessful upgrade attempt and a corrupted `active.img`, the partition likely did not have enough free space for the upgrade to succeed.

To fix the issue, perform the following steps:

1. If your cluster has two or more nodes, access the remaining nodes via SSH and check the disk usage of `active.img` and `passive.img`.
   ```
   # du -sh /run/initramfs/cos-state/cOS/*
   1.7G    /run/initramfs/cos-state/cOS/active.img
   3.1G    /run/initramfs/cos-state/cOS/passive.img
   ```
   If `passive.img` consumes 3.1G of disk space, run the following commands using the root account:
   ```
   # mount -o remount,rw /run/initramfs/cos-state
   # fallocate --dig-holes /run/initramfs/cos-state/cOS/passive.img 
   # mount -o remount,ro /run/initramfs/cos-state
   ```
   `passive.img` is converted to a sparse file, which should only consume 1.7G of disk space (the same as `active.img`). This ensures that the other nodes have enough free space, preventing the upgrade process from becoming stuck again.

1. Access the stuck node via SSH, and then run the following commands using the root account:
   ```
   # mount -o remount,rw /run/initramfs/cos-state
   # cp /run/initramfs/cos-state/cOS/passive.img \
        /run/initramfs/cos-state/cOS/active.img
   # tune2fs -L COS_ACTIVE /run/initramfs/cos-state/cOS/active.img
   # mount -o remount,ro /run/initramfs/cos-state
   ```
    The existing (clean) `passive.img` is copied over the corrupted `active.img` and the label is set correctly.

1. Reboot the stuck node, and then select the first entry ("Harvester v1.4.1") on the GRUB boot screen.

    The GRUB boot screen initially displays "Harvester v1.4.1 (fallback)" by default. Despite the displayed version, the system boots into Harvester v1.4.0.

1. Copy `rootfs.squashfs` from the Harvester v1.4.1 ISO to a convenient location on the stuck node.

    The ISO can be mounted either on the stuck node or on another system. You can copy the file using the `scp` command.

1. Access the stuck node via SSH, and then run the following commands using the root account:
   ```
   # mkdir /tmp/manual-os-upgrade    
   # mkdir /tmp/manual-os-upgrade/config
   # mkdir /tmp/manual-os-upgrade/rootfs
   # mount -o loop rootfs.squashfs /tmp/manual-os-upgrade/rootfs
   # cat > /tmp/manual-os-upgrade/config/config.yaml <<EOF
   upgrade:
     system:
       size: 3072
   EOF
   # elemental upgrade \
           --logfile /tmp/manual-os-upgrade/upgrade.log \
           --directory /tmp/manual-os-upgrade/rootfs \
           --config-dir /tmp/manual-os-upgrade/config \
           --debug
   ```
    :::note

    You must replace the sample path in the fourth line with the actual path of the copied `rootfs.squashfs`.

    :::   

    A new (clean) `active.img` is generated based on the root image from the Harvester v1.4.1 ISO.
    
    If any errors occur, save a copy of `/tmp/manual-os-upgrade/upgrade.log`.
    
1. Run the following commands:
   ```
   # umount /tmp/manual-os-upgrade/rootfs
   # reboot
   ```
    The node should boot successfully into Harvester v1.4.1, and the upgrade should proceed as expected.

### 4. Upgrade will start over again unexpectedly after clicking the "Dismiss it" button

When you use Rancher to upgrade Harvester, the Rancher UI displays a dialog with a button labeled "Dismiss it". Clicking this button may result in the following issues:

- The `status` section of the `harvesterhci.io/v1beta1/upgrade` CR is cleared, causing the loss of all important information about the upgrade.
- The upgrade process starts over again unexpectedly.

This issue affects Rancher v2.10.x, which uses v1.0.2, v1.0.3, and v1.0.4 of the [Harvester UI Extension](../rancher/harvester-ui-extension.md#support-matrix). All Harvester UI versions are not affected. The issue will be fixed in Harvester UI Extension v1.0.5 and v1.5.0.

To avoid this issue, perform either of the following actions:

- Use the Harvester UI to upgrade Harvester. Clicking the "Dismiss it" button on the Harvester UI does not result in unexpected behavior.
- Instead of clicking the button on the Rancher UI, run the following command against the cluster:

```
kubectl -n harvester-system label upgrades -l harvesterhci.io/latestUpgrade=true harvesterhci.io/read-message=true
```
