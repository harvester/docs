# Upgrade from v1.0.2 to v1.0.3

## General information

The Harvester GUI Dashboard page should have an upgrade button to perform an upgrade. For more details please refer to [start an upgrade](./automatic.md#start-an-upgrade).

For the air-gap env upgrade, please refer to [prepare an air-gapped upgrade](./automatic.md#prepare-an-air-gapped-upgrade).

## Known issues

---

### 1. Fail to download the upgrade image

**Description**

Downloading the upgrade image can't be complete or fails with an error.

- [[BUG] failed to create upgrade image](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2104)

**Workaround**

Delete the current upgrade and start over. Please see ["Start over an upgrade"](troubleshooting.md#start-over-an-upgrade).

### 2. An upgrade is stuck, a node is in "Pre-drained" state (case 1)

**Description**

Users might see a node is stuck at the Pre-drained state for a while (> 30 minutes).

![](/img/v1.0/upgrade/known_issues/2053-stuck.png)


This might be caused by `instance-manager-r-*` pod on node `harvester-z7j2g` can’t be drained. To verify the above case:

- Check rancher server logs:
    
    ```
    kubectl logs deployment/rancher -n cattle-system
    ```
    
    Example output:
    
    ```
    error when evicting pods/"instance-manager-r-10dd59c4" -n "longhorn-system" (will retry after 5s): Cannot evict pod as it would violate the pod's disruption budget.
    evicting pod longhorn-system/instance-manager-r-10dd59c4
    error when evicting pods/"instance-manager-r-10dd59c4" -n "longhorn-system" (will retry after 5s): Cannot evict pod as it would violate the pod's disruption budget.
    evicting pod longhorn-system/instance-manager-r-10dd59c4
    error when evicting pods/"instance-manager-r-10dd59c4" -n "longhorn-system" (will retry after 5s): Cannot evict pod as it would violate the pod's disruption budget.
    evicting pod longhorn-system/instance-manager-r-10dd59c4
    error when evicting pods/"instance-manager-r-10dd59c4" -n "longhorn-system" (will retry after 5s): Cannot evict pod as it would violate the pod's disruption budget.
    ```
    
- Verify the pod `longhorn-system/instance-manager-r-10dd59c4` is on the stuck node:
    
    ```
    kubectl get pod instance-manager-r-10dd59c4 -n longhorn-system -o=jsonpath='{.spec.nodeName}'
    ```
    
    Example output:
    
    ```
    harvester-z7j2g
    ```
    
- Check degraded volumes:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get volumes -n longhorn-system
    ```
    
    Example output:
    
    ```
    NAME                                       STATE      ROBUSTNESS   SCHEDULED   SIZE          NODE              AGE

    pvc-7b3fc2c3-30eb-48b8-8a98-11913f8314c2   attached   healthy      True        10737418240   harvester-x9jqw   3d
    pvc-8065ed6c-a077-472c-920e-5fe9eacff96e   attached   healthy      True        21474836480   harvester-x9jqw   3d
    pvc-9a40e5b9-543a-4c90-aafd-ac78b05d7599   attached   degraded     True        10737418240   harvester-x9jqw   2d23h
    pvc-9a6539b8-44e5-430e-9b24-ea8290cb13b7   attached   healthy      True        53687091200   harvester-x9jqw   3d13h
    ```
    
    Here we can see volume `pvc-9a40e5b9-543a-4c90-aafd-ac78b05d7599` is degraded.
    
:::note

The user needs to check all degraded volumes one by one.

:::
    
- Check degraded volume’s replica state:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get replicas -n longhorn-system --selector longhornvolume=pvc-9a40e5b9-543a-4c90-aafd-ac78b05d7599 -o json | jq '.items[] | {replica: .metadata.name, healthyAt: .spec.healthyAt, nodeID: .spec.nodeID, state: .status.currentState}'
    ```
    
    Example output:
    
    ```
    {
      "replica": "pvc-9a40e5b9-543a-4c90-aafd-ac78b05d7599-r-15e31246",
      "healthyAt": "2022-07-25T07:33:16Z",
      "nodeID": "harvester-z7j2g",
      "state": "running"
    }
    {
      "replica": "pvc-9a40e5b9-543a-4c90-aafd-ac78b05d7599-r-22974d0f",
      "healthyAt": "",
      "nodeID": "harvester-279l2",
      "state": "running"
    }
    {
      "replica": "pvc-9a40e5b9-543a-4c90-aafd-ac78b05d7599-r-bc6f7fa5",
      "healthyAt": "",
      "nodeID": "harvester-x9jqw",
      "state": "stopped"
    }
    ```
    
    Here the only healthy replica is `pvc-9a40e5b9-543a-4c90-aafd-ac78b05d7599-r-15e31246` and it’s on node `harvester-z7j2g`. So we can confirm the `instance-manager-r-*` pod resides on node `harvester-z7j2g` and avoids the drain.


**Related issues**

- [[BUG] Upgrade: longhorn-system can't be evicted](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2053)


**Workaround**

We need to start the “Stopped” replica, from the previous example, the stopped replica’s name is `pvc-9a40e5b9-543a-4c90-aafd-ac78b05d7599-r-bc6f7fa5`. 

- Check the Longhorn manager log, we should see a replica waiting for the backing image. First, we need to get the manager's name:
    
    ```
    kubectl get pods -n longhorn-system --selector app=longhorn-manager --field-selector spec.nodeName=harvester-x9jqw
    ```
    
    Example output:
    
    ```bash
    
    NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    longhorn-manager-zmfbw   1/1     Running   0          3d10h
    ```
    
- Get pod log:
    
    ```
    kubectl logs longhorn-manager-zmfbw -n longhorn-system | grep pvc-9a40e5b9-543a-4c90-aafd-ac78b05d7599-r-bc6f7fa5
    ```
    
    Example output:
    
    ```
    (...)

    ```
    
    Here we can determine the replica is waiting for the backing image `harvester-system-harvester-iso-n7bxh`.
    
- Get the disk file map from the backing image:
    
    ```
    kubectl describe backingimage harvester-system-harvester-iso-n7bxh -n longhorn-system
    ```
    
    Example output:
    
    ```bash
    (...)

    ```
    
    The disk file with UUID `3830342d-c13d-4e55-ac74-99cad529e9d4` has the state `in-progress`.
    
- Next, we need to find backing-image-manager that contains this disk file:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get pod -n longhorn-system --selector=longhorn.io/disk-uuid=3830342d-c13d-4e55-ac74-99cad529e9d4
    ```
    
    Example output:
    
    ```
    NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    backing-image-manager-c00e-3830   1/1     Running   0          3d1h
    ```
    
- Restart the backing-image-manager by deleting its pod:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl delete pod -n longhorn-system backing-image-manager-c00e-3830
    ```

### 3. An upgrade is stuck, a node is in "Pre-drained" state (case 2)

**Description**

Users might see a node is stuck at the Pre-drained state for a while (> 30 minutes).

![](/img/v1.0/upgrade/known_issues/2640-stuck.png)

Here are some steps to verify this issue has happened:

- Visit the Longhorn GUI: `https://{{VIP}}/k8s/clusters/local/api/v1/namespaces/longhorn-system/services/http:longhorn-frontend:80/proxy/#/volume` (replace VIP with an appropriate value) and check degraded volumes. The degraded volume might contain a healthy replica only (with blue background) and the healthy replica resides on the "Pre-drained" node:

    ![](/img/v1.0/upgrade/known_issues/2640-vol-1.png)

- Hover the mouse to the red scheduled icon, the reason is `toomanysnapshots`:

    ![](/img/v1.0/upgrade/known_issues/2640-vol-2.png)


**Related issues**

- [[BUG] Upgrade is stuck in "Pre-drained" state (Volume has too many system snapshots)](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2640)


**Workaround**

- In the "Snapshots and Backup" panel, toggle the "Show System Hidden" switch and delete the latest system snapshot (which is just before the "Volume Head").

    ![](/img/v1.0/upgrade/known_issues/2640-vol-3.png)

- The volume will continue rebuilding to resume the upgrade.
