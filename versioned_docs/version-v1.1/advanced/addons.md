_Available as of v1.1.0_

Beginning with v1.1.0, Harvester will make optional functionality available as Addons.

One of the key reasons for the same is to ensure that Harvester installation footprint can be kept low while allowing users to enable/disable functionality based on their use case or requirements.

Some level of customization is allowed for each addon, which depends on the underlying addon.

v1.1.0 currently ships with two Addons:
* [pcidevices-controller](./pcidevices.md)
* [vm-import-controller](./vmimport.md)
