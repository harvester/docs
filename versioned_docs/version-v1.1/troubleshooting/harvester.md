## Fail to Deploy a Multi-node Cluster Due to Incorrect HTTP Proxy Setting

### ISO Installation Without a Harvester Configuration File

#### Configure HTTP Proxy During Harvester Installation

In some environments, you configure [http-proxy](../airgap/#configure-an-http-proxy-during-installation) of [OS Environment](../install/harvester-configuration.md#osenvironment) during Harvester installation.

#### Configure HTTP Proxy After First Node is Ready

After the first node is installed successfully, you login into the `Harvester GUI` to configure [http-proxy](../airgap.md#configure-an-http-proxy-in-harvester-settings) of [Harvester System Settings](../install/harvester-configuration.md#system_settings).

Then you continue to add more nodes to the cluster.

#### One Node Becomes Unavailable

The issue you may encounter:

```
The first node is installed successfully.

The second node is installed successfully.

The third node is installed successfully.

Then the second node changes to Unavialable state and cannot recover automatically.
```

#### Solution

When the nodes in the cluster do not use the HTTP Proxy to communicate with each other, after the first node is installed successfully, you need to configure [http-proxy.noProxy](../airgap.md#configure-an-http-proxy-in-harvester-settings) against the CIDR used by those nodes.

For example, your cluster assigns IPs from CIDR `172.26.50.128/27` to nodes via DHCP/static setting, please add this CIDR to `noProxy`.

After setting this, you can continue to add new nodes to the cluster.

For more details, please refer to [Harvester issue 3091](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3091).

### ISO Installation With a Harvester Configuration File

When a Harvester configuration file is used in ISO installation, please configure proper `http-proxy` in [Harvester System Settings](../install/harvester-configuration.md#system_settings).

### PXE Boot Installation

When [PXE Boot Installation](../install/pxe-boot-install.md) is adopted, please configure proper `http-proxy` in [OS Environment](../install/harvester-configuration.md#osenvironment) and [Harvester System Settings](../install/harvester-configuration.md#system_settings).

## Generate a Support Bundle

Users can generate a support bundle in the Harvester GUI with the following steps:

- Click the `Support` link at the bottom-left of Harvester Web UI.
    ![](/img/v1.1/troubleshooting/harvester-sb-support-link.png)

- Click `Generate Support Bundle` button.
    ![](/img/v1.1/troubleshooting/harvester-sb-support-button.png)

- Enter a useful description for the support bundle and click `Create` to generate and download a support bundle.

## Access Embedded Rancher and Longhorn Dashboards

_Available as of v1.1.0_

You can now access the embedded Rancher and Longhorn dashboards directly on the `Support` page, but you must enable the `Developer Tools & Features` first via the Preference page.

![](/img/v1.1/troubleshooting/support-access-embedded-ui.png)

For previous versions, you can access them manually through:
- `https://{{HARVESTER_IP}}/dashboard/c/local/explorer` (Embedded Rancher)
- `https://{{HARVESTER_IP}}/dashboard/c/local/longhorn` (Embedded Longhorn)


:::note

We only support using the embedded Rancher and Longhorn dashboards for debugging and validation purposes.
For Rancher's multi-cluster and multi-tenant integration, please refer to the docs [here](../rancher/rancher-integration.md).

## I can't access Harvester after I changed SSL/TLS enabled protocols and ciphers

If you changed
[SSL/TLS enabled protocols and ciphers settings](../advanced/settings.md#ssl-parameters)
and you no longer have access to Harvester GUI and API,
it's highly possible that NGINX Ingress Controller has stopped working due to the misconfigured SSL/TLS protocols and ciphers.
Follow these steps to reset the setting:

1. Following [FAQ](../faq.md) to SSH into Harvester node and switch to `root` user.
```
$ sudo -s
```
2. Editing setting `ssl-parameters` manually using `kubectl`:
```
# kubectl edit settings ssl-parameters
```
3. Deleting the line `value: ...` so that NGINX Ingress Controller
will use the default protocols and ciphers.
```
apiVersion: harvesterhci.io/v1beta1
default: '{}'
kind: Setting
metadata:
  name: ssl-parameters
...
value: '{"protocols":"TLS99","ciphers":"WRONG_CIPHER"}' # <- Delete this line
```
4. Save the change and you should see the following response after exit from the editor:
```
setting.harvesterhci.io/ssl-parameters edited
```

You can further check the logs of Pod `rke2-ingress-nginx-controller` to see if NGINX Ingress Controller is working correctly.
