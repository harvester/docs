This section describes how to use Harvester in an air gapped environment. Some use cases could be where Harvester will be installed offline, behind a firewall, or behind a proxy.

The Harvester ISO image contains all the packages to make it work in an air gapped environment.

## Working Behind an HTTP Proxy

In some environments, the connection to external services, from the servers or VMs, requires an HTTP(S) proxy.

### Configure an HTTP Proxy During Installation

You can configure the HTTP(S) proxy during the [ISO installation](./install/iso-install.md) as shown in picture below:

### Configure an HTTP Proxy in Harvester Settings

You can configure the HTTP(S) proxy in the settings page of the Harvester dashboard:

1. Go to the settings page of the Harvester UI.
1. Find the `http-proxy` setting, click **â‹® > Edit setting**
1. Enter the value(s) for `http-proxy`, `https-proxy` and `no-proxy`.

:::note

Harvester appends necessary addresses to user configured `no-proxy` to ensure the internal traffic works.
i.e., `localhost,127.0.0.1,0.0.0.0,10.0.0.0/8,longhorn-system,cattle-system,cattle-system.svc,harvester-system,.svc,.cluster.local`. `harvester-system` was added into the list since v1.1.2.

When the nodes in the cluster do not use a proxy to communicate with each other, the CIDR needs to be added to `http-proxy.noProxy` after the first node is installed successfully. Please refer to [fail to deploy a multi-node cluster](./troubleshooting/harvester.md#fail-to-deploy-a-multi-node-cluster-due-to-incorrect-http-proxy-setting).
