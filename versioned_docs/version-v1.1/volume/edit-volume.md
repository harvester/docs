After creating a volume, you can edit your volume by clicking the `⋮` button and selecting the `Edit Config` option.

## Expand a Volume

You can expand a volume by increasing the value of the `Size` parameter directly.
To prevent the expansion from interference by unexpected data R/W, Harvester supports `offline` expansion only. You must shut down the VM or detach the volume first if it is attached to a VM, and the detached volume will automatically attach to a random node with [maintenance mode](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.3.2/concepts/#22-reverting-volumes-in-maintenance-mode) to expand automatically.

## Cancel a Failed Volume Expansion

If you specify a size larger than Longhorn's capacity during the expansion, the status of the volume expansion will be stuck in `Resizing`. You can cancel the failed volume expansion by clicking the `⋮` button and selecting the `Cancel Expand` option.
