Description: The Harvester provides a virtual IP as the management address.
---

Harvester provides a fixed virtual IP (VIP) as the management address, VIP must be different from any Node IP.  You can find the management address on the console dashboard after the installation.

:::note

If you selected the IP address to be configured via DHCP, you will need to configure static MAC-to-IP address mapping on your DHCP server in order to have a persistent Virtual IP

## How to get the VIP MAC address

To get the VIP MAC address, you can run the following command on the management node:
```shell
$ kubectl get svc -n kube-system ingress-expose -ojsonpath='{.metadata.annotations}'
```

Example of output:
```json
{"kube-vip.io/hwaddr":"02:00:00:09:7f:3f","kube-vip.io/requestedIP":"10.84.102.31"}
```

## Usages
The management address has two usages.

- Allows the access to the Harvester API/UI via `HTTPS` protocol.
- Is the address the other nodes use to join the cluster.
