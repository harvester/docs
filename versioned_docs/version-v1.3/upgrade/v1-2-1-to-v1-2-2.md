## Known issues

### 1. The `harvester-seeder` add-on is not upgraded

When upgrading Harvester clusters from v1.2.1 to v1.2.2, the `harvester-seeder` add-on is not fully upgraded due to the chart version mismatch:

```
Error: chart "harvester-seeder" matching 0.1.0 not found in harvester-seeder index. (try 'helm repo update'): no chart version found for harvester-seeder-0.1.0
```

The `harvester-seeder` chart version bundled with Harvester v1.2.2 is 0.1.1. However, the `harvester-seeder` add-on remains to use the 0.1.0 chart. The same situation will happen if you enable the add-on after upgrading to Harvester v1.2.2, you will notice the chart could not be installed successfully with the similar messages as above.

The workaround is to manually update the `harvester-seeder` Addon manifest (if it's already enabled, please disable it before patching):

```
kubectl -n harvester-system patch addons.harvesterhci harvester-seeder --type=json -p '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/version", "value": "0.1.1"}]'
```
